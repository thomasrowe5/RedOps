# Ethics and Safety Commitments

## Lab-Only, Non-Exploitation Policy
All RedOps capabilities are developed and exercised exclusively within controlled laboratory environments. The project team does not condone or support using these tools for unauthorized access, exploitation, or any activity that violates applicable laws or ethical norms. Any attempt to deploy components outside sanctioned lab scenarios is strictly prohibited.

## Built-In Safety Mechanisms
The orchestrator enforces guardrails that validate run requests, constrain target scopes to pre-approved lab hosts, and prevent execution of destructive payloads. Agents implement complementary checks, including strict command allowlists, rate limiting of active operations, and telemetry hooks that surface anomalous behavior for immediate review. Together these controls create multiple layers of defense against unsafe actions or misuse.

## Reproducibility and Responsible Disclosure
Experiments are designed to be reproducible through version-controlled infrastructure definitions, deterministic lab datasets, and pinned dependencies. When new vulnerabilities or security findings emerge from RedOps research, the team follows a responsible disclosure process: notifying affected vendors, granting remediation time, and coordinating any public communication with stakeholders to minimize risk.
